# DJI-Onboard-SDK-for-Mavlink
## Introduction
This project is succeeded from Xuhao1's project. I update it with lastest Onboard SDK and remove the dependancy of 'ROS'.
Origin project:  https://github.com/xuhao1/dji_sdk

This is a server program for M100 & Mavlink comunication.

So you can use QGroundStation to control your M100.

Moreover, waypoints is supported.

I suggest that please activate your M100 by sample provided by DJI Onboard SDK before running this program.

Also, please make sure you are able to get the control right, when you wants to run this program.
